# MarkIt

## Overview
This is a web app that allows users to save links, which will be stored in their account and accessible from any device. Users can:
* Create folders to categorize their bookmarks
* Search and sort bookmarks within folders
* Share a folder by making it publicly viewable through a link
* Share a folder by inviting specific users to view or edit

The app can be viewed [here](https://jchou8.github.io/info343-finalproject/).
