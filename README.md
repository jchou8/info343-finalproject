## Overview
This is a web app that allows users to save links, which will be stored in their account and accessible from any device. Users can:
* Create folders to categorize their bookmarks
* Search and sort bookmarks within folders
* Share a folder by making it publicly viewable through a link
* Share a folder by inviting specific users to view or edit

The app can be viewed [here](https://jchou8.github.io/info343-finalproject/).

## Getting started
* Once you log in or create an account, you'll be taken to your home screen, which lists all your folders. The sidebar also allows you to navigate between your folders.

    * To create a folder, click on the "Create Folder" button in the sidebar, enter a folder name, and click the "Add Folder" button.

* Once inside a folder, you can add a bookmark by pressing the "Add Link" button. You can then enter a name for the bookmark, along with the bookmark's URL, then press the "Add Bookmark" button to add it to the folder.
    * Clicking on a bookmark's name or URL will take you to that URL. On the right side of each bookmark is three buttons that allow you to move it to a different folder, edit its name/URL, or delete it.

* When inside of a folder, at the top of the screen, there are three buttons to share the folder, edit the folder's name, or delete the folder.

* There are two options to share a folder - by enabling public link, and by inviting specific users by email.

    * Enabling public link will allow anyone with the folder's URL to view the folder. This can also be disabled at any time to make the folder private again.

    * When inviting specific users, you can give them edit permissions, which will let them add/edit/remove links in the folder. You can also limit them to viewing the folder.

    * Pressing the X next to a user that you have shared the folder with will unshare it with them.
